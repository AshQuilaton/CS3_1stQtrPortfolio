# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1.   Variable Decleration - There are several different ways to declare variables, wether it would be let and const, where a value would be assigned. To assign a variable, we can use an equal sign then what the value you would want it to be, for example it would be like 'let ExampleVariable = 10;', where the value 10 would be assigned to the variable ExampleVariable.
2. JavaScript Operations - JavaScript has many variables and there are also Operations for these variables. There are assignment operators, where you assign a value to a variable. There are also operators that does arithmetic, for example addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
3. Output statements - There are many ways to output a statement, and different types of code for each. There could be document.write(), console.log() and many more. 
4. Control Statements - When it comes to code, we need to use different statements to direct the flow of how the code works. You could use if else, switch and loop statements, allowing our code to flow properly. 
5. Loop Control Structures - If we would like to repeat a block of code for many purposes, we could use loop control structures. There are three, which is while(), do{} while(), and for()in, these have all different purposes and different yet similar functions that wouuld allow us to repeat code.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Commonly Used Javascript Number Objects - I honestly have a hard time memorizing all the built in properties and how they work. I understand that they're all useful in several cases and how they function but the I need further practice so I'd be able to memorize and remember what to use and when to use them.
2. Input Functions - Input functions are a little bit complicated for me, so I would have a hard time fully understanding how the code works, since sometimes I would have errors whenever I'd try to make an input function.
3. Event Handlers -  I don't really understand the concept of triggers and events, including how to make the code for it.
4. Custom functions - I often get confused on how the process goes and i would often be lost in how the code works.
5. Pre-defined functions - similarly to the custom functions, I'd often get lost and confused on how the process goes. I also didn't really have enough time to fully understand the lesson.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. I would take more of my time to practice codes, as it would help me apply what I know, however if I would do more research about the parts of the code which I don't understand.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. Kahoot - I feel like the kahoot quizzes allowed me to practice what I remember from the lessons and allows me to learn from my mistakes. It was also very fun in my opinion, so it would often get my attention and allows me to focus.
2. The Coding part of quizzes - It allowed me to apply what I've learned and to see how we could use it when we want to be able to code something. It also lets us play with how our coding style is, letting us experiment our own ways while trying to achieve the same goal.

1. The Graded Exercises - Even if it is similar to the coding part of the quizzes, the graded exercises being done during class right after the lesson gives me a slightly hard time, since often I would be still be processing the lesson and so I would be confused when we're made to code it immediately when I haven't fully understood the lesson. 
2. I feel like it was only the graded exercises that didn't really think were effective for me, the other activities were all helpful and allowed me to learn.
